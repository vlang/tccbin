# tccbin

This is based on prebuilt [tcc compiler](https://repo.or.cz/tinycc.git), cut at commit [53d815b](https://repo.or.cz/tinycc.git/commit/53d815b8a0364a85b66c3b37884fca087b923267) (20200822) from mob branch. 

Please note that it is intended to be a *minimalism* version just enough to support V on *32-bit Windows*. One of the beauties of tcc is its portability. 

However, you may find this [official full version of tcc](http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/tinycc/winapi-full-for-0.9.27.zip) helpful as it includes many extra header files.
